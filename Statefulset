ðŸ”¥ Where to create /mnt/data:
On the worker node, where the StatefulSet pods will be scheduled.

Each worker node that may run the pod must have this directory (/mnt/data) created on it.



âš¡ Note:
If you have multiple worker nodes and you want your pod to run on a specific node (where the /mnt/data directory is created), you need to use node affinity or taints/tolerations.

If you have multiple nodes and they donâ€™t have the /mnt/data directory, the pod will fail to start because Kubernetes wonâ€™t find the required directory on those nodes.
